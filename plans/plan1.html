        <h2>The Training You Will Receive</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>The training will be for two years, in which you will learn about many things such as science, like medical procedures, public speaking, etc.</li>
          <br>
          <li>To feel what you will be doing in space, you will practice life-sized models, also known as mock-ups. The Space Vehicle Mock-up Facility (SVMF) is where you will practice.</li>
          <br>
          <li>To work in zero gravity, you will board a plane known as the Vomit Comet providing you with 20-25 seconds of zero gravity.</li>
          <br>
          <li>To practice extravehicular activities, or spacewalks, you will use the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL), a large "swimming pool." You will be practicing on full-sized models of space vehicles.</li>

<b>Launch:</b>
<br>
<span class="body-text">
The space shuttle is fueled with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, which are stored in external tanks attached to the main shuttle body.
Once the fueling is complete, the shuttle is moved to the launch pad and secured in place.
The launch countdown begins, during which various systems are checked and monitored.
At liftoff, the shuttle's main engines ignite and the solid rocket boosters ignite a few seconds later.
The shuttle rises vertically into the sky, propelled by the engines and boosters.
After about two minutes, the boosters separate and fall back to Earth, while the shuttle continues its ascent into orbit.
Once the shuttle reaches orbit, it separates from the external tank and prepares for its mission.

<br>
<b>Retrieval:</b>
<br>
<span class="body-text">
At the end of the shuttle's mission, it prepares to return to Earth.
The shuttle re-enters Earth's atmosphere, which creates intense heat and friction.
To slow down, the shuttle deploys its landing gear and uses a combination of aerodynamic braking and thruster firings.
The shuttle glides towards a runway, similar to a plane, and makes a horizontal landing.
The shuttle is then towed to a hangar for post-flight processing and refurbishment, in preparation for its next mission.
It's important to note that the space shuttle program has been retired, with the final shuttle mission taking place in 2011. However, many of the technologies and techniques used in the space shuttle program continue to be used in other space programs."
